# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Science Conjoint.
* I am taking STATS 220 because:
  1. One of my majors is Statistics
  2. And I feel that this course would equip me with more valuable skills that I can use further down the road.
* I am interested in learning about new coding languages such as R, and how it connects/inter-connects with statistics.
