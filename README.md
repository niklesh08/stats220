# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Science Conjoint.
- I am taking STATS 220 because one of my majors is Statistics and I feel that this course would equip me with more valuable skills that I can use further down the road.
- I am interested in learning about new languages such as R, and how it connects/inter-connects with statistics.
